# advent-of-code-2015

Going back and doing all the advent of codes in my spare time. Only a few years late on this one...

# Build
```
$ cd ~/workingDirectory
$ git clone https://github.com/nullcoalescence/advent-of-code-2015.git
$ cd advent-of-code-2015.git
$ dotnet run
# Or open .csproj or .sln file in Visual Studio and build and run there
```
